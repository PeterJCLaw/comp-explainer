\section{Student Robotics Competition 2014}

\subsection{Introduction}

Welcome to the competition \textbf{SCHOOL_LONG_NAME}! Troughout the competition
teams will be referred to by their three letter acronyms (\textbf{TLA}). For
your team your TLA is \textbf{SCHOOL_TLA}.

This document contains a lot of helpful information about the
competition including how everything's going to break down and some of
the rules we'd like you to follow whilst on site.

\subsection{Pits and floor plan}

Each team has a pit, and yours is marked on this diagram in red:

TODO: diagram

On the floor plan you'll also see the ``power tools area''. This is the only
place in the competition venue that power tools can be used.

There are two lifts in the venue, one of them is explicitly only for teams that are coming
down from the second floor to their matches. Please use the other lift at all
times, unless you are going to a match.

\subsection{Day Schedule}

This is the schedule for the two days of the competition.

\subsection{League Matches}

As per the rules, the league matches are run to seed the knock out
round. Each league match has four teams. The winner of each league match
wins 4 league points, the first runner up wins 3 league points, the
second runner up wins 2 league points, and the loser of the match wins 1
league points. In the case of a draw between any of these positions
league points are averaged.

Please ensure you are at any league match you are in precisely at the time
indicated. \textbf{Matches will not be delayed for teams that are not present}.
Teams that do not show up to a match will get 0 league points.


There are 216 league matches this year, 108 in each arena. Matches
between the two arenas will be run syncronously. The schedule for the
league matches is given below, any matches containing your team have
been \textbf{emboldended}. CN means that your robot is in corner n, for example
CO means that your robot is in corner 0.
